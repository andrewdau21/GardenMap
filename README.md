# GardenMap

This application leverage a google sheet to display detailed information about my garden in 2022.  The application has multiple components described below.

## Map

The map is built using <code>plotly</code> and allows for hover, click and zoom functionality.  The map itself is a replicated copy of my garden layout.  I am using garden mats with pre drilled holes purchased from [gardenmats.com](https://gardenmats.com).  I would expect this layout to be consistent from year to year moving forward.

## Table
This is a data dump of one of the sheets from the google sheets workbook.  It contains important information about all planting both in the primary garden, but also secondary gardens throughout the property.
